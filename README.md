# Password Generator

## Description

Click Generate Password to create a strong randomized password based on character choices. 

My first JavaScript application not only taught me diffent functions and intricacies of the language, but also how to think like a developer. I had to break this large task down into smaller pieces in order to guide myself through each step of code.

Pseudo-coding was essential in this project!

## Usage

Click Generate Password and answer each prompt to generate a random password. You may then copy and paste your password from the display to use as you need. 

If no options are picked, an error message will display "try again!"
